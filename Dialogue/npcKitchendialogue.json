	{"name":"Kenji","text":"That's me! What can I make for you today? We have a special roll with fresh tuna, avocado, and a hint of Spicefall seasoning"},
	{"name":"Cena","text":"That sounds delicious. But I heard rumors that you use some... unusual methods to cook. Is it true you work with deadly spells?"},
	{"name":"Kenji","text":"Ah, you've heard about that, huh? It's true, I use a bit of magic to get the best flavors and textures. And a word of advice: if you hear any loud noises from the kitchen, it's just the Bladefury spell doing its work"},
	{"name":"Cena","text":"Alright then, I won't ask too many questions. I'm looking forward to trying this. Thanks, Chef!"},
